The thesis abstract provides a concise description of the main contributions in the thesis.
Abstracting and indexing services usually include the thesis abstract in the catalog presented to users.
A well-written abstract could improve the chances of your work being discovered and cited by others in the research community.
The abstract should be self-contained (avoid citations and cross references) and should contain only plain text (avoid complicated mathematical expressions).}
